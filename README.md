## Overview

This setup installs and configures:

- AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI
- Python virtual environment
- CPU-only PyTorch (no CUDA / no ROCm)
- Required Python packages and ARM-related fixes
- Unified launcher (`~/run_sd.sh` by default)
- Integrated GUI launcher
- Bundled GUI banner
- Optional desktop shortcut and application menu entry
- Clean uninstall handled through `run_sd.sh`

Designed for **Raspberry Pi OS**, **Debian**, and other ARM Linux distributions.

---

## Supported Architectures

The installer prints your detected CPU architecture during setup and installs
CPU-only PyTorch from the official PyTorch CPU wheel index.

---

### ARM64 aarch64 recommended

This is the **preferred and most reliable configuration**.

**Details:**
- Uses **official CPU-only PyTorch wheels**
- Installed from the official PyTorch CPU index
- Fully compatible with modern Python versions

**Why ARM64 is recommended:**
- Faster installation
- Fewer dependency issues
- Better performance
- Works best on Raspberry Pi 4 / 5 (64-bit OS)

---

### ARM32 armv7l best-effort

ARM32 (32-bit Raspberry Pi OS) support is **best-effort only**.

**How it works:**
- The setup uses the same CPU-only PyTorch install path
- No separate ARM32 wheel fallback is included
- No source builds are attempted by the setup script

**Limitations:**
- ARM32 may not have compatible PyTorch wheels available
- Significantly slower than ARM64
- Higher memory pressure
- More likely to fail during Python package installation

**If installation fails on ARM32:**
- Switch to a **64-bit Raspberry Pi OS**
- Re-run the setup script on the 64-bit OS

---

## Architecture Detection & Install Logic

This setup script displays the detected architecture using:

```bash
uname -m
```

The current setup does **not** use separate install branches for ARM64 and ARM32.
It uses the official PyTorch CPU wheel index and applies the same install flow.

### Installation Behavior

- Removes piwheels references from pip configuration
- Updates and upgrades the system packages
- Installs required dependencies
- Creates a clean Python virtual environment
- Clones AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI
- Checks out a pinned WebUI commit
- Installs CPU-only PyTorch
- Installs WebUI requirements
- Installs `pytorch-lightning==1.9.5`
- Installs OpenAI CLIP
- Patches `modules/launch_utils.py` for ARM compatibility
- Optionally downloads default models
- Creates the unified launcher, optional GUI launcher, bundled banner, optional desktop shortcut, and optional menu entry

This keeps the setup consistent and repeatable.

---

## System Requirements

- git
- curl
- wget
- build-essential
- libgl1
- libglib2.0-0
- python3-tk, Pillow, DejaVu fonts, zenity, and lxterminal when GUI/launcher options are enabled

---

## Installation

Install everything with **one command**:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comp6062/rpi-automatic1111/main/setup_sd.sh | bash
```

Or using wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comp6062/rpi-automatic1111/main/setup_sd.sh | bash
```

Or from this bundle folder:

```bash
chmod +x setup_sd.sh
./setup_sd.sh
```

The installer opens an interactive CLI menu before installation begins.

### The installer will

- Install system dependencies
- Remove piwheels entries from pip configuration
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Clone AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI
- Check out the pinned WebUI version used by this installer
- Install CPU-only PyTorch
- Install Python requirements
- Install ARM-related Python fixes
- Patch WebUI launch utilities
- Download default models when selected
- Create the unified launcher `run_sd.sh`
- Install the Stable Diffusion GUI launcher when selected
- Install the bundled GUI banner when GUI is selected
- Create a desktop shortcut and application menu entry when selected

---

## Interactive CLI Options

The setup asks for:

1. Download included models on or off
2. Install the GUI launcher or not
3. Create a desktop shortcut or not
4. Create a menu launcher or not
5. Where to place installed files

The default install location is your home folder:

```bash
~/
```

With the default location, the installer creates:

```bash
~/stable-diffusion-webui
~/stable-diffusion-env
~/run_sd.sh
```

If you choose a different install location, those files are created inside that folder instead.

---

# Model Download Control (Setup Script)

## Default Model Download Behavior

Model downloads are optional in the interactive installer.  
If enabled, the setup downloads two example Stable Diffusion models during installation.

The default downloaded models are:

- CyberRealistic V7.0 FP16
- Realistic Vision V5.1 Inpainting

---

## Enable Model Downloads

Choose **yes** when asked:

```text
Download included models? [y/N]: y
```

When enabled:
- Missing models are downloaded automatically
- Existing models are never overwritten
- Setup remains controlled by the interactive CLI

---

## Disable Model Downloads During Setup

Choose **no** or press Enter at the model prompt:

```text
Download included models? [y/N]: 
```

When disabled:
- No models are downloaded during setup
- Installation still completes normally
- The WebUI can be launched after setup
- Models can be added later manually

---

## Adding Models Manually (Optional)

If model downloads are disabled, place your `.ckpt` or `.safetensors` files in:

```bash
stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusion/
```

Restart the WebUI after adding new models.

---

## Running Stable Diffusion

Launch the unified launcher:

```bash
~/run_sd.sh
```

If you installed to a custom folder, run:

```bash
/path/to/install/run_sd.sh
```

Then choose from the launcher menu. The installed launcher is the main control file for starting LAN mode, starting offline mode, stopping a running WebUI process, uninstalling, or quitting.

The desktop shortcut and application menu entry launch the integrated GUI, which uses the same installed `run_sd.sh` workflow.

### LAN Mode

LAN mode starts WebUI with:

```bash
--skip-torch-cuda-test --no-half --listen
```

The launcher prints the Raspberry Pi LAN URL, usually:

```text
http://<pi-ip-address>:7860
```

**Important:** After installation completes, run Stable Diffusion once using **LAN Mode while connected to the internet**. During this first launch, AUTOMATIC1111 may download and install additional required files and dependencies. After the first successful online launch, Stable Diffusion can be run using **Offline Mode** without internet access.

---

## GUI Launcher

The setup installs an integrated GUI launcher when selected during setup.

Installed GUI files are placed in the selected install location:

- `.sd_gui_runner.sh`
- `.sd_gui_app.py`
- `.sd_gui_banner.png`

The desktop shortcut is created at:

```bash
~/Desktop/StableDiffusionGUI.desktop
```

The menu launcher is created at:

```bash
~/.local/share/applications/sd-gui.desktop
```

The GUI launcher provides the same Stable Diffusion controls as the installed setup, including LAN mode, offline mode, stop running, open WebUI, uninstall, and quit.

The GUI is packaged by the installer and uses the bundled banner image installed at `.sd_gui_banner.png`. No separate `gui.sh` or separate banner download is required when the current `setup_sd.sh` is installed directly from GitHub with `curl` or `wget`.

---

## Offline Mode

Offline mode runs Stable Diffusion using already installed files and models.

Offline mode starts WebUI with:

```bash
--skip-torch-cuda-test --no-half --listen --skip-install
```

Offline mode:

- Uses already downloaded models
- Skips package installation and updates
- Can run without internet after the first successful setup and first launch
- Runs on port `7860`

Open WebUI from the Pi itself with:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

Or from another device on the same LAN with:

```text
http://<pi-ip-address>:7860
```

---

## Uninstalling

To completely remove everything, run:

```bash
~/run_sd.sh
```

If you installed to a custom folder, run:

```bash
/path/to/install/run_sd.sh
```

Then select **Uninstall** from the launcher or from the GUI launcher.

The uninstall process removes:

- Stable Diffusion WebUI
- Python virtual environment
- `run_sd.sh`
- GUI launcher script
- GUI application file
- Bundled GUI banner
- Desktop shortcut
- Application menu entry
- Temporary GUI PID file

---

## Known Limitations

- CPU-only inference (no GPU acceleration)
- ARM64 is strongly recommended
- ARM32 is best-effort only
- Large models may exceed available RAM
- First launch should be run with internet access
- First generation can take several minutes on Raspberry Pi hardware
- GUI launcher requires a desktop environment with `zenity`, `lxterminal`, Python Tkinter, and Pillow

## Recommendation Summary

| Architecture | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| ARM64 (aarch64) | Recommended |
| ARM32 (armv7l) | Best effort only |

If installation fails on ARM32, switch to a **64-bit OS**.  
That is the intended and supported upgrade path.
